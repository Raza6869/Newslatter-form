## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with syntax for types.

### What I learned

In this litte project, I started my studies with Typescript. Honestly, I liked so much, bringing more organization to my code is really impressive. On the other hand, I praticed more with the react context toll, which I used frequently in my latest projects.

Another thing I learned it's the image change when the screen is resized to bring responsiveness to the project interface.

### Continued development

After this project, which I made just for pratice and return to my studies, I wanna do some like a full-stack project to learn more about the back-end. After all, my objective in this carrer it's be a Fulltack Engeneer.

But, the focus right now, it's typescript and MongoDB.
